# Create Custom Images
1. Dockerfile : A Docker file is a text file that 
is going to have a couple of lines of configuration placed inside of it.
this configuration is going to define how out container behaves. Or more 
specifically what different programs its going to contain and what it 
does when it start up.
2. Docker Client : docker cli that we have been using at our terminal in turn.
3. Docker Server: the Server what is doing a heavy lifting for us.Get instraction 
from the configuration line and build a useable image that can then be used to start
up a new container.
4. Useable Image.
